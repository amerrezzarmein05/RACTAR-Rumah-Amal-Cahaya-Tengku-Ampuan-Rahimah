      <h3>Our History</h3>
      <p>RACTAR (Rumah Amal Cahaya Tengku Ampuan Rahimah) was established in 1993 in loving memory of the late Tengku Ampuan Rahimah, the former Queen of Selangor. Known for her generosity and compassion, her legacy lives on through this home dedicated to underprivileged girls.</p>
      <p>The home started in a small rented house in Subang Jaya with just 6 girls under care. Through tireless community support and contributions from kind-hearted donors, RACTAR expanded its facilities and now houses over 30 children, providing them with education, healthcare, and emotional support.</p>
